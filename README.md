**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room was a Game Developer that had only developed for Android OS. They wanted to expand and scale; to this goal, they wanted to build a web-based game.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I meticulously went through the pros, cons strengths and weaknesses of each Operating Platform.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Developing the UML first was helpful in visualizing how the code would be structured.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would improve by including more details related to the architecture of each operating system, and its dedicated hardware.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I directly addressed my User's needs and detailed my solutions within the design document, and production code. This pertains to Active Listening. The User tells the Business Owner what their needs are, and the Business Entity provides a solution and payment arrangement. Without this relationship, the business could not exist.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I used a modular, bottom up approach to designing software. I start with the Parent component before completing the child counterpart. I believe this strategy will be beneficial to utilize in the future.
